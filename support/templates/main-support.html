        <p>SBS was born in 2012 as MSBS, the Michigan Scratch Bowling Series. Brian Regan started these bowling tournaments as a competitive bowler himself and with the help of Aaron Phillips and a few others. The need being fulfilled was for better run tournaments with the bowlers in mind on challenging conditions.<br><br>Phillips built the best tournament website around which displays live scoring results, as well as the history of oil patterns as they were used at previous events, and history of bowling centers who have hosted our events, and then a history of each bowlerâ€™s previous results. There are not any other bowling websites like this that we have seen.<br><br>In the Summer of 2013 MSBS became the Midwest Scratch Bowling Series, as we were booking events in Indiana, Ohio, and even Illinois already. In later years we would even run tournaments in Wisconsin and Minnesota!</p>

        <p>In 2020 and 2021 it has become apparent that there is demand for us to run more tournaments in more states. We have already run over 900 events in less than 9 years! Not only do we run our own MSBS events, but we have been hired by several other groups/people to run events for them as well. Phillips has helped us every step of the way by adding features here and there to the website and fixing any problems that arise, and he continues to run some events for us each year.<br><br>With the growing demand, we see that we need to do a lot more in terms of tournament software, growing the website, and live streaming our events to bring them to the rest of the country and even to grow a global audience.<br><br>Now we present to you our new name as we shorten it to "Scratch Bowling Series". This will give us more flexibility to run events in more places. If we run an event in Phoenix, AZ, we can call it an "SBS Arizona" event, or we can run a series on the East Coast called "SBS East Coast". The new tournament software and website we are building will make the whole process easier to use!</p>

        <p>Our goal now is to continue our path of innovation and to create a tournament software which will integrate with an enhanced website to make running tournaments more efficient to operate from afar. We want to bring our formats, our oil patterns, and our competition to the rest of the country. To top it off we are going to build a top-notch live streaming platform that will set a new bar of excellence and excitement to the sport of bowling.<br><br>If you like what we have done up to this point, imagine our past being about 2-3% of what we hope to accomplish in the future. This is why we are running this Kickstarter. In order to grow and innovate, we now need some help to get there. Thank you in advance for your consideration of supporting this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
